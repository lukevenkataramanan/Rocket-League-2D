# Rocket-League-2D

I created a 2D version of the popular video game, Rocket League. I used PyCharm and the Pygame module to create the project.

Rocket League is a video game that is summed up in 2 words: car soccer. Rocket power cars are used to hit the ball into the other team's goals, and this game utilizes physics very heavily. My 2D recreation of the game is simplified in that there are only 2 dimensions, but it still has to take into account friction, gravity, net forces, and impulses, just like the original game.

I created this as one of my spring semester projects in my Computer Science Independent Study class in 2021.
